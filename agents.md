# AI Agent Best Practices (2025)

Modern agentic systems combine reasoning-capable models, dynamic tool chains, and robust control loops. The practices below consolidate guidance from current platform docs and production case studies to help teams ship reliable agents quickly while leaving room for domain-specific tailoring.[1][2][3][4][5]

## Design the Agent Stack
- Start with a modular workflow that explicitly chooses the model, tools, guardrails, knowledge, and logic layers so each component can evolve independently.[1]
- Treat the agent loop as a controllable runtime; design for state inspection, overrides, and pluggable middleware before adding domain logic.[3]
- Plan for long-horizon work by budgeting space for planner nodes, sub-agents, and shared workspaces from the outset.[2]

## Planning & Task Decomposition
- Reinforce deliberate reasoning with detailed system prompts, worked examples, and explicit instructions for how tools should be invoked.[2]
- Add lightweight planning tools (even no-op planners) to keep the model oriented on the current goal and subgoals.[2]
- Use chains-of-thought, tree search, or external planners when tasks branch or require deep exploration.[4]

## Memory & Knowledge Management
- Pair short-term conversational context with persistent memory such as vector stores or file-backed scratch space to prevent context loss.[1][2][4]
- Define clear retention policies for memory writes so the agent does not accumulate stale or redundant state.[2]
- Prefer retrieval systems that support approximate nearest neighbor search for scale while keeping recall high.[4]

## Tooling & Execution Control
- Curate a minimal, well-documented tool catalog and instruct the model on when each tool should be used.[2][5]
- Enforce guardrails (validation, moderation, policy checks) at the tool boundary to catch misuse before execution.[1][3]
- Allow the agent to adjust tool parameters dynamically (e.g., RAG filters, batch sizes) instead of hard-coding them.[5]

## Orchestration & Middleware
- Insert pre- and post-model middleware to summarize context, route control flow, or request human feedback without forking the core loop.[3]
- Capture model requests in middleware so you can swap models, tweak prompts, or change tool availability at runtime.[3]
- Keep middleware small and composable; layer multiple behaviors (summarization, human-in-the-loop, prompt caching) rather than building monoliths.[3]

## Evaluation & Observability
- Instrument traces for every agent run so you can replay decision paths, grade outcomes, and spot regressions.[1]
- Combine automated evals (unit tests, dataset runs, leaderboard tasks) with human spot checks to cover both quantitative and qualitative quality.[1][5]
- Track metrics per agent, per tool, and per scenario to surface drift in resolution time, success rate, or hallucination frequency.[1]

## Safety, Guardrails & Human Oversight
- Layer guardrails in the loop: validate inputs before planning, interrupt risky actions after model calls, and require approvals for sensitive operations.[1][3]
- Provide optional human-in-the-loop middleware so operators can review tool calls that exceed risk thresholds.[3]
- Encourage reflective critiques after significant actions so the agent can self-correct before finalizing output.[4]

## Multi-Agent Collaboration
- Spawn specialized sub-agents for complex projects, giving each focused prompts and scoped tools.[2]
- Use a shared workspace (files, memory slots, task boards) so collaborating agents can exchange artifacts asynchronously.[2][5]
- Establish hand-off conventions (status notes, success criteria) to prevent infinite loops or duplicated work between agents.[2]

## Deployment, Sharing & UX
- Embed production agents behind tested chat surfaces or APIs (e.g., ChatKit or equivalent) to control launch velocity and rollback safety.[1]
- Keep prompts, tool configs, and environment variables transparent so teammates can audit and extend the agent easily.[5]
- Offer shareable templates or starter workflows to accelerate onboarding and community feedback.[5]

## Implementation Checklist
- [ ] Document the agent’s model, tools, guardrails, and memory stores in the repo.
- [ ] Provide a system prompt with clear objectives, tool usage guidance, and safety constraints.[2]
- [ ] Register planning and evaluation hooks (middleware, sub-agents, or planners) before adding new features.[2][3]
- [ ] Configure persistent memory (vector store, file workspace) with retention and cleanup routines.[1][2]
- [ ] Add automated eval runs plus trace grading or leaderboard-style benchmarks where available.[1][5]
- [ ] Establish human override paths for high-risk actions and regularly review sampled traces.[3][4]
