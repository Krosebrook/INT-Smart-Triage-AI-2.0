# Environment Variables Template for INT Smart Triage AI 2.0
# 
# IMPORTANT: This file is for reference only. 
# DO NOT add actual values here - use Vercel environment variables instead.
#
# Configure these in your Vercel Dashboard:
# https://vercel.com/dashboard/[your-project]/settings/environment-variables

# Supabase Configuration
# Get these from: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/[your-project]/settings/api
SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project-id.supabase.co
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-service-role-key-here

# Clerk Authentication Configuration
# Get these from: https://dashboard.clerk.com/
CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_your-publishable-key-here
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_your-secret-key-here

# Optional: Node.js Environment
NODE_ENV=production

# Security Notes:
# - Never commit actual values to version control
# - Always use service_role key, never anon key for production
# - These variables are automatically encrypted in Vercel
# - RLS policies ensure database security regardless of key exposure
# - Clerk publishableKey is fetched dynamically from server to prevent client-side exposure
# - This prevents hardcoded authentication keys in client-side code (security vulnerability)
