# Customer Success Metrics & Analytics

## Overview
This document outlines key performance indicators (KPIs) and metrics used to measure Customer Success Representative (CSR) performance, customer satisfaction, and business health. These metrics support data-driven decision making and continuous improvement of customer experience.

## Core Metrics

**Scale**: 1-5 (1=Very Unsatisfied, 5=Very Satisfied)

#### Targets & Benchmarks
- **Target**: ≥ 4.5/5.0 (90%+ satisfaction)
- **Minimum Acceptable**: ≥ 4.0/5.0 (80% satisfaction)
- **Industry Benchmark**: 4.2/5.0 (84% satisfaction)

#### Measurement Frequency
- **Real-time**: After each resolved ticket
- **Reporting**: Daily, Weekly, Monthly
- **Reviews**: Monthly team reviews, Quarterly strategic reviews

#### CSAT Improvement Actions
- **4.5+**: Maintain current practices, identify best practices
- **4.0-4.4**: Investigate specific pain points, implement targeted improvements
- **<4.0**: Immediate investigation, process review, additional training

### 2. First Call Resolution (FCR)

**Definition**: Percentage of customer issues resolved on first contact without escalation or follow-up
**Calculation**: (Tickets resolved on first contact / Total tickets) × 100

#### Targets & Benchmarks
- **Target**: ≥ 75%
- **Minimum Acceptable**: ≥ 70%
- **Industry Benchmark**: 74%

#### FCR Categories
- **Technical FCR**: 65% target (complexity factor)
- **Billing FCR**: 85% target (straightforward processes)

- **General FCR**: 80% target (information requests)

#### FCR Impact Factors
- Agent training and knowledge base completeness
- Ticket routing accuracy and system integration
- Authorization levels and process efficiency
- Customer communication and expectation setting

### 3. Net Revenue Retention (NRR) & Gross Revenue Retention (GRR)

#### Net Revenue Retention (NRR)
**Definition**: Measures revenue growth from existing customers including expansions minus churn
**Calculation**: ((Starting ARR + Expansion ARR - Churned ARR - Contraction ARR) / Starting ARR) × 100

##### NRR Targets
- **Target**: ≥ 110%
- **Minimum Acceptable**: ≥ 100%
- **Best-in-Class**: ≥ 120%

#### Gross Revenue Retention (GRR)
**Definition**: Measures revenue retention from existing customers excluding expansions
**Calculation**: ((Starting ARR - Churned ARR - Contraction ARR) / Starting ARR) × 100

##### GRR Targets
- **Target**: ≥ 95%
- **Minimum Acceptable**: ≥ 90%
- **Best-in-Class**: ≥ 98%

#### Revenue Retention Drivers
- Customer satisfaction and success outcomes
- Product adoption and feature utilization
- Proactive customer success management
- Effective renewal and expansion processes

### 4. Customer Churn Rate

**Definition**: Percentage of customers who cancel or don't renew their subscription
**Calculation**: (Customers lost during period / Total customers at start of period) × 100

#### Churn Rate Targets
- **Monthly Churn**: ≤ 2%
- **Annual Churn**: ≤ 10%
- **Voluntary vs. Involuntary**: Track separately for targeted interventions

#### Churn Analysis Dimensions
- **By Segment**: Enterprise, Mid-market, SMB
- **By Tenure**: 0-3 months, 3-12 months, 12+ months
- **By Product**: Feature usage and adoption patterns
- **By Geography**: Regional performance variations

#### Early Warning Indicators
- Decreased product usage (30%+ decline)
- Support ticket volume increase
- CSAT scores below 3.5
- Payment delays or billing disputes
- Key contact changes or departures

## Secondary Metrics

### 5. Average Handle Time (AHT)
- **Target**: ≤ 8 minutes for standard tickets
- **Calculation**: Total handle time / Number of tickets handled

### 6. Time to Resolution (TTR)
- **Critical**: ≤ 4 hours (Target: 2 hours)
- **High**: ≤ 24 hours (Target: 12 hours)
- **Medium**: ≤ 72 hours (Target: 48 hours)
- **Low**: ≤ 7 days (Target: 5 days)

### 7. SLA Compliance Rate
- **Target**: ≥ 98%
- **Calculation**: (Tickets meeting SLA / Total tickets) × 100

### 8. Customer Effort Score (CES)
- **Survey Question**: "How easy was it to get your issue resolved?"
- **Scale**: 1-7 (1=Very Difficult, 7=Very Easy)
- **Target**: ≥ 6.0/7.0

### 9. Knowledge Base Utilization
- **Self-Service Resolution Rate**: Target ≥ 40%
- **Article Effectiveness**: Average rating ≥ 4.0/5.0
- **Search Success Rate**: Target ≥ 85%
