## 📞 Questions & Answers

### Q: Why 2 weeks instead of rushing in 1 week?

**A:** Quality over speed. 2 weeks allows for proper testing, bug fixes, and polish while maintaining realistic expectations.

### Q: What if we want to skip Tier 2 and go straight to Tier 3?

**A:** Not recommended. Tier 2 validates market demand and provides essential enterprise features needed before scaling.

### Q: Can we pause after MVP if needed?

**A:** Absolutely. Each tier is designed to be complete and valuable on its own.

### Q: What if competitors launch similar features?

**A:** Our AI-powered triage and sentiment analysis provide unique differentiation. Plus, our incremental approach allows us to adapt quickly.

### Q: How confident are you in the ROI projections?

**A:** Tier 1-2 ROI is conservative and achievable. Tier 3 projections are based on industry benchmarks but should be validated with pilot customers first.
