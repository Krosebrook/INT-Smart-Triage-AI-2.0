## Two Paths Forward

### Option A: Complete All 32 Articles NOW (10-15 hours)
**Approach**: Write remaining 27 articles at 2,000-2,500 words each
**Estimated Time**: 10-15 hours total
**Result**: Complete KB library ready to go

**Pros**:
- Complete content library
- No need to come back to this task
- All departments equally represented

**Cons**:
- Delays deployment by 10-15 hours
- System already works without them
- Large upfront time investment

### Option B: Deploy System + Add Articles Incrementally (RECOMMENDED)
**Approach**: Ship what exists, add 5 articles per week
**Week 1**: Deploy + test (done immediately)
**Week 2**: Add 5 Technology articles (KB-TECH-002 through 005)
**Week 3**: Add 5 Website Design articles  
**Week 4**: Add 5 Branding articles
**Week 5**: Add 5 Content articles
**Week 6**: Add 5 Marketing articles
**Week 7**: Add 5 Operations articles + final 2

**Pros**:

**Cons**:
