# Git Setup Instructions

Your code is ready to push to GitHub! Follow these steps:

## 1. Create a GitHub Repository

Go to [GitHub](https://github.com/new) and create a new repository:
- Repository name: `int-client-success-platform` (or your preferred name)
- Description: "AI-Powered Client Success Platform with 15+ integrated features"
- Make it Public or Private (your choice)
- **DO NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)

## 2. Add GitHub Remote

After creating the repository, run these commands in your terminal:

```bash
# Replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/int-client-success-platform.git

# Or if using SSH:
git remote add origin git@github.com:YOUR_USERNAME/int-client-success-platform.git
```

## 3. Push to GitHub

```bash
# Push your code to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

## 4. Verify

Visit your GitHub repository URL to confirm all files are uploaded.

## Alternative: Push to Existing Repository

If you already have a repository:

```bash
# Add your existing repo as remote
git remote add origin YOUR_REPO_URL

# Push to main branch
git push -u origin main
```
