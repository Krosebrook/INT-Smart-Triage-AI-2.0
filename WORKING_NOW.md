# ✅ INT SMART TRIAGE AI 2.0 - NOW WORKING!

## 🎉 The 404 Error is FIXED

Your app now works perfectly on bolt.new! No more "Error Processing Request" or 404 errors.

## What Was Wrong

1. **API endpoints** (`/api/health-check` and `/api/triage-report`) are Node.js serverless functions that only work on Vercel
2. **Bolt.new can't run serverless functions** - it only runs client-side code
3. **Solution**: Moved ALL triage logic to client-side JavaScript
