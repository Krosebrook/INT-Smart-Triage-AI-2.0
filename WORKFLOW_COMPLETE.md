# ✅ INT Smart Triage AI 2.0 - Complete Workflow Implemented

## What Was Requested

> "After a query is submitted there needs to be a way to navigate from it as well as see all other submissions for that client"

## What Was Delivered

### 1. ✅ Post-Submission Navigation
After submitting a triage, users see a **"Next Actions"** card with 3 buttons:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 📊 Next Actions                                         │
│                                                         │
│ [View All Reports for Customer Name]                   │
│ [Browse All Reports]                                    │
│ [Create New Triage]                                     │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```
