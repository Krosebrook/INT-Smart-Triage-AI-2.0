## Case Studies & Testimonials (Actual)

### INT Rebrand

When INT decided to modernise its own brand, they approached the project as they would a client engagement. The case study explains that a strong brand involves both "voice" and "face"; developing a cohesive identity required deep understanding of the company's history, values and target audience[^1]. Key challenges included maintaining objectivity, gaining leadership buy‑in and preserving brand equity[^1]. The solution involved defining a tone of voice, new tagline and positioning statement ("Our Purpose is Your Business"), designing a new logo that symbolises support and connectivity[^1], and redesigning the website with improved navigation and consistent visuals[^1]. The rebrand strengthened INT's market position and prepared the company for growth[^1].

### Send a Care Package Today (Website design for SACPT)

A Chicago‑based organisation wanted a resource hub to simplify sending military care packages. INT designed a custom WordPress website complete with a new logo and visual identity[^1]. Challenges included creating a brand identity from scratch, building an intuitive interface and integrating third‑party links[^1]. INT performed research, logo design and custom theming, integrated third‑party resources and conducted QA testing[^1]. The result was a user‑friendly site that smoothly directs visitors to relevant services and includes ongoing hosting and updates[^1].

### INT SOC 2 Compliance

To demonstrate its commitment to security, INT pursued SOC 2 attestation. The case study notes that clients rely on INT for secure managed services and that obtaining SOC 2 reinforces trust[^1]. Challenges included meeting stringent security standards, integrating cross‑functional processes and building robust documentation[^1]. INT conducted a risk assessment, strengthened security controls, instilled a culture of security, and built monitoring systems[^1]. Achieving SOC 2 improved client confidence, strengthened market position and enhanced internal processes[^1].

### Fictional Case Studies (Best Practices)

To cover additional scenarios and inspire training for the triage app, here are fictional case studies based on common client needs.

#### Manufacturing SaaS Migration & BI

**Acme Tools Inc.** is a mid‑size manufacturing company with outdated on‑premise software. INT conducts a discovery assessment and recommends migrating to a suite of SaaS applications (ERP, CRM and support desk). The team handles data migration, integrates the new SaaS tools with existing systems and trains staff. INT then deploys AI Your BI℠ to analyse production data, revealing bottlenecks and predicting inventory needs. As a result, Acme reduces downtime, improves forecasting and gains real‑time dashboards.

#### Startup Brand & Website Launch

**GreenStride** is a sustainable footwear startup. INT develops the brand strategy (mission, positioning and voice), designs a memorable logo and creates a fully customised e‑commerce website with integrated content strategy. The site launches with SEO‑optimised copy, product videos and an accessible design. GreenStride secures strong initial brand recognition and achieves a 30% conversion rate within three months.

#### Healthcare Compliance & Marketing

**Heartland Cardiology** wants to attract new patients while ensuring HIPAA compliance. INT performs an InfoSec discovery to assess security, implements controls and assists with a cyber‑insurance questionnaire. Simultaneously, INT's marketing team develops a content plan with educational blog posts and sends targeted email campaigns. The result is a compliant, secure practice with a growing patient base.

#### Retail Process Management & Marketing Automation

**Urban Threads**, a boutique clothing retailer, struggles with manual processes and inconsistent marketing. INT streamlines operations by mapping existing workflows, implementing an inventory management system and training staff. The marketing team sets up automation workflows for abandoned‑cart emails and loyalty campaigns. Sales increase while staff reclaim time previously spent on manual tasks.
